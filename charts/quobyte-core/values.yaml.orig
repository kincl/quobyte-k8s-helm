# Name of the nodepool in which the Quobyte services will be deployed.
# This must be a dedicated nodepool that is used to run Quobyte services
# exclusively and have sufficient resources to run all required services.
# The separate nodepool is required for performance isolation to avoid
# other workloads from impacting your storage.
# Minimum node pool size is 4 machines.
nodepoolname: pool-1

# external-dns allows you to use your Quobyte cluster from outside the Kubernetes
# cluster, e.g. from bare metal machines or VMs or across data centers.
# When enabled it will create one DNS CNAME record for each registry and one
# CNAME record for the cluster that contains all registry endpoints.
# The records are automatically updated when the IP of a service changes.
# For this to work you have to use host networking.
# See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns for more details.
